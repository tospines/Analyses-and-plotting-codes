Direct inputs and outputs from the DRAGON2 runs with the propagation parameters obtained from the combined and Standard analyses obtained in ...

Here you can find the inputs (.xml and .source.param files) to pass to the DRAGON2 (customized) code - https://github.com/tospines/Customised-DRAGON2_beta - as well as the jupyter notebook code to make the plots of protons, helium and antiprotons. The employed datasets (extracted from https://tools.ssdc.asi.it/CosmicRays/) are also available in this repository. Just change the file paths.
The rest of nuclei can be obtained in the same way as in https://github.com/tospines/Analyses-and-plotting-codes/tree/main/CR_spectra-Plots

The tables with antiproton yields (flux of antiprotons at Earth) from DM annihilation into the bbbar channel are also here for the NFW and Burket DM profiles in the Milky Way. These are computed with DarkSusy.
