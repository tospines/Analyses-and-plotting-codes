Direct inputs and outputs from the DRAGON2 runs with the propagation parameters obtained from the combined and Standard analyses obtained in ...

Here you can find the inputs (.xml and .source.param files) to pass to the DRAGON2 (customized) code - https://github.com/tospines/Customised-DRAGON2_beta - as well as the jupyter notebook code to make the plots of protons, helium and antiprotons. The employed datasets (extracted from https://tools.ssdc.asi.it/CosmicRays/) are also available in this repository. Just change the file paths.
The rest of nuclei can be obtained in the same way as in https://github.com/tospines/Analyses-and-plotting-codes/tree/main/CR_spectra-Plots
