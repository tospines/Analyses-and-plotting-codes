Direct inputs and outputs from the DRAGON2 runs with the propagation parameters obtained from the combined analysis obtained in ... (to be submitted soon)

Here you can find the inputs (.xml and .source.param files) to pass to the DRAGON2 (customized) code - https://github.com/tospines/Customised-DRAGON2_beta - as well as the jupyter notebook code to make the plots of the spectra of primary CRs (H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg and Si) as well as the ratios of the secondary CRs B, Be, Li, F and antiprotons. The employed datasets (extracted from https://tools.ssdc.asi.it/CosmicRays/) are also available in this repository. Just change the file paths.
The rest of nuclei can be obtained in the same way as in https://github.com/tospines/Analyses-and-plotting-codes/tree/main/CR_spectra-Plots
In this way, we show here that there is a configuration of propagation parameters and scale factors for the normalization of the cross sections parametrizations of the secondary CRs that allows us to reproduce simulataneously all the relevant observables for CR propagation studies, demonstrating that the experimental antiproton data is compatible with production from CR spallation interactions (pure secondary origin).

The tables with antiproton yields (flux of antiprotons at Earth) from DM annihilation into the bbbar channel are also here for the NFW and Burket DM profiles in the Milky Way. These are computed with DarkSusy.
